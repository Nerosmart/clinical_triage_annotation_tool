Dear Cardiology Team,

I am referring a 68-year-old male with a 3-month history of exertional chest discomfort. 
He reports central tightness when walking uphill, relieved by rest within minutes. 
Past history includes hypertension and hyperlipidaemia. ECG in clinic shows non-specific ST changes. 
No red-flag symptoms such as syncope or resting pain.

Please assess for possible stable angina.
