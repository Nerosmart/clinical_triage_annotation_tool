I am referring a 57-year-old male with a 4-week history of exertional breathlessness. 
He denies chest pain but reports occasional orthopnoea. 
Past history includes hypertension and mild COPD. 
BNP is mildly elevated at 210. ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy.

Please assess for possible early heart failure.
