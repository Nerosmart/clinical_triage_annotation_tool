I would like your opinion on a 72-year-old male with progressive shortness of breath over 6 months. 
He now struggles with minimal exertion. Bilateral ankle swelling noted. 
Past history: MI (2012), type 2 diabetes.  
BNP elevated at 780. ECG shows old inferior infarct.

Suspected heart failure—please review.
